# Ocean Markdown extension for VS Code

Ocean-flavored Markdown ([OFM]) is a custom Markdown specification tailored for literature. This extension handles syntax highlighting and preview of OFM in VS Code.

## Features

- Proper code highlighting for [OFM]
- Proper rendering of [OFM] in preview
- Basic commands and keyboard shortcuts for writing [OFM]

## Known Issues

- Because it implements Ocean-flavored Markdown, this extension breaks VS Code's built-in handling of the Commonmark specification. This may be surprising to people who are accustomed to working with Markdown in VS Code.

- Markdown in RTL languages (Farsi, Arabic, Hebrew) is not supported in VS Code.

## Release Notes

See [CHANGELOG.md].
